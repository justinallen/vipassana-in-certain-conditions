			<p>"Vipassana in Certain Conditions" is an experiment in electronic poetry by poet Casey Clague and designer and writer <a href="https://justinallen.us">Justin Allen</a>.</p>
			 <p>It consists of two sets of lines written by Casey Clague during a trip to Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand which included a meditation retreat. </p>
			 <p>Allen and Clague jointly concieved a reader experience of randomly paired stanzas, which are generated dynamically when the reader takes an action. Allen created the visual experience and interactivity with CSS and JavaScript.</p> 
			 <p>The lines appear like thoughts that arise unbidden during meditation, some recurring and nagging. As those are dismissed, new ones appear after an interval. </p>
			 <p>The slowly shifting background gradient and quiet visual composition are meant to complement and guide the reader experience to an introspective and receptive modality, and also offset the sometimes dissonant and jagged impression of the words themselves.</p>
